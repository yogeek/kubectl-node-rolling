  shortDescription: >-
    Shutdown cluster nodes sequentially & gracefully
  homepage: https://github.com/yogeek/kubectl-node-rolling
  caveats: |
    Execution of this plugin requires Kubernetes cluster-admin Rolebindings
    and the ability to schedule Privileged Pods.
  description: |
    This plugin performs a sequential, rolling shutdown of selected nodes by first
    draining each node, then running a Kubernetes Job to shutdown each node, and
    finally waiting for the node to be replaced by a new one 
    by an external component (like an AutoScaling Group).
